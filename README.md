# typecript-express
I've created this repo to learn to use TypeScript with ExpressJS. 

## Getting Started

1. run `npm install` at root folder

2. cd into root folder and run `npm run watch-ts` to start TypeScript compiler

3. cd into root folder on another terminal and run `npm run watch-node` to start express server
